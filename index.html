    <h1>About Me</h1> 

<h2>During lockdown, I started learning how to code as something to do to take my mind off the crippling loneliness that had sunk in. </h2>

<ol> Qualities
    <li>Fantastic at selecting good snacks for events</li>
    <li>Knows a lot of Simpsons quotes</li>
    <li>Exceptionally Tenacious</li>
</ol>

<ul> Hobbies and Interests
    <li>PS4 Gaming. I completed Bloodborne, which for the girls that get it, get it. For those who don't, don't.</li>
    <li>Cooking a variety of noodle based meals. Spam is surprisingly good in noodles</li>
    <li>Horror Films. My icon is Sidney Prescott and I once had a meet and greet with the actress who plays her and I cried</li>
    <li>Running. I have a love/hate relationship with running. I hate preparing to go for a run but I love the actual run</li>
    <li>Cats. I have two cats named Ham and Pickle and they're ridiculous creatures</li>
</ul>
